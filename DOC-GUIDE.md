# üìù Beginner Data Engineer Documentation & Presentation Guide

This guide is for documenting and presenting your group‚Äôs **dimensional modeling exercise**.  
Follow the structure below, fill in your team‚Äôs work, and use it as both internal documentation and a final presentation outline.  

---

## 1. Project Overview

- **Dataset Used:**  
  *(Briefly describe the dataset and domain ‚Äî e.g., Chinook music store, OULAD education dataset, or IMDb entertainment dataset.)*  

- **Goal of the Exercise:**  
  *(What was the objective? Example: transform OLTP schema into dimensional star schema for analytics.)*  

- **Team Setup:**  
  *(State if you worked individually, as a group, or both. Mention collaboration style.)*  

- **Environment Setup:**  
  *(Describe your environment ‚Äî local vs remote, individual vs shared instances. Example: Docker containers on a shared VM + local laptops.)*

## 2. Architecture & Workflow

- **Pipeline Flow:**  
  *(Diagram or describe: raw ‚Üí clean ‚Üí mart ‚Üí BI.)*  

- **Tools Used:**  
  - Ingestion: `dlt`  
  - Modeling: `dbt`  
  - Visualization: `Metabase`  
  *(Add others if used.)*  

- **Medallion Architecture Application:**  
  - **Bronze (Raw):** Initial ingestion of source data  
  - **Silver (Clean):** Cleaning, type casting, handling missing values  
  - **Gold (Mart):** Business-ready star schema for BI  

*(Insert diagram or screenshot here if possible.)*

## 3. Modeling Process

- **Source Structure (Normalized):**  
  *(Describe how the original tables were structured ‚Äî 3NF, relationships, etc.)*  

- **Star Schema Design:**  
  - Fact Tables: *(e.g., FactSales, FactAssessment, FactRatings)*  
  - Dimension Tables: *(e.g., Customer, Date, Genre, Student, Demographics, Title, Person)*  

- **Challenges / Tradeoffs:**  
  *(E.g., handling missing data, many-to-many joins, exploding arrays, performance considerations.)*  

---

## 4. Collaboration & Setup

- **Task Splitting:**  
  *(How the team divided ingestion, modeling, BI dashboards, documentation.)*  

- **Shared vs Local Work:**  
  *(Issues faced with sync conflicts, version control, DB connections, etc.)*  

- **Best Practices Learned:**  
  *(E.g., using Git for dbt projects, naming conventions, documenting assumptions, group debugging sessions.)*  

---

## 5. Business Questions & Insights

- **Business Questions Explored:**  
  1. *(Example: Who are the top customers by revenue?)*  
  2. *(Example: What factors contribute to student dropout?)*  
  3. *(Example: Which genres/actors perform best in ratings?)*  

- **Dashboards / Queries:**  
  *(Add screenshots, SQL snippets, or summaries of dashboards created in Metabase.)*  

- **Key Insights:**  
  - *(Highlight 1‚Äì2 interesting findings. Example: ‚ÄúRock was the top genre in North America, while Latin genres dominated in South America.‚Äù)*  

---

## 6. Key Learnings

- **Technical Learnings:**  
  *(E.g., SQL joins, window functions, dbt builds/tests, schema design.)*  

- **Team Learnings:**  
  *(E.g., collaboration in shared environments, version control, importance of documentation.)*  

- **Real-World Connection:**  
  *(How this exercise relates to actual data engineering workflows in industry.)*  

---

## 7. Future Improvements

- **Next Steps with More Time:**  
  *(E.g., add orchestration with Airflow/Prefect, implement testing, optimize queries, handle larger datasets.)*  

- **Generalization:**  
  *(How this workflow could be applied to other datasets or business domains.)*

## üì¢ Presentation Tips

- Keep it **5‚Äì10 minutes**, like a project walkthrough.  
- Use **diagrams, screenshots, and SQL snippets**.  
- Focus on both **technical process** and **business insights**.  
- End with your **key learnings and future improvements**.  
- For other documentation tips. Read [this](TECHNICAL-DOCS.md).
